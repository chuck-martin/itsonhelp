<h1>Bundles</h1>
<p>Bundles are containers for two or more plans and fees that are treated as a single product. There are different types of bundles. Each type has different behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic bundles: A basic bundle is nothing more than a grouping with a name. When a basic bundle is bought, each plan is received individually, and each plan retains its own usage limit and defined behavior (renewability, proration, cycle length, etc.). Plans within a basic bundle are independent and if they are renewable, can be canceled separately. Bottom line: the plans within a basic bundle are separate after bundle purchase.</li>
<li>Compound bundles: A compound bundle is a group of plans where the behavior (renewability, proration, cycle length, etc.) is set at the bundle level. Plans within a compound bundle can have dependencies and cannot be canceled separately. Bottom line: the plans within a compound bundle are not treated separately after you purchase the bundle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain product types can and cannot be added to different types of bundles. The following table illustrates this.</p>

<h2 id="Bundles-BundleUsage">Bundle Usage</h2>
<p>If you want to offer a bunch of plans collectively that retain their own behavior and cycle length and that can be managed individually by subscribers once purchased, use a basic bundle.</p>
<p>If you want to offer a bunch of plans collectively that are connected, that you want to have similar behavior and cycle length and that can be managed by subscribers only as a collection, use a compound bundle.</p>
<h2 id="Bundles-BundleExamples">Bundle Examples</h2>
<p>This section shows you some ways to use bundling.</p>
<h3 id="Bundles-BasicPlanCombination">Basic Plan Combination</h3>
<p>Many users want a combination of talk, text, and data. A compound bundle lets you offer plans of all three types with a single purchase.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to offer unlimited voice, unlimited text, and 1GB of data. You create a plan for each. Each plan also has an individual price. You create a compound bundle and set a bundle price, which overrides the individual pricing. Customers who buy this bundle get all three plans. They are not allowed to cancel one of the plans in the bundle because they are all "attached" to each other through the compound bundling.&#160;</p>
<h3 id="Bundles-FreeDataPromotion">Free Data Promotion</h3>
<p>You are looking to encourage your customers to buy specific plans, perhaps because they are more profitable or easier to manage. You want to offer a free data plan if they buy specific other plans. This is a good use of a basic bundle.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to offer 10MB of free data that can be used anytime if a customer buys one of your top-tier voice or messaging plans. You create a plan for the data. That plan has settings that do not allow it to be renewed with an unlimited duration, which means that the customer will receive it once, and when they do, they will always have the data to use until it has been fully depleted. You then create basic bundles, each that contains one of the top-tier plans and the data plan. Customers who buy one of the top-tier voice or messaging plans get the data plan. The plans themselves are separate on the customer's account.</p>
