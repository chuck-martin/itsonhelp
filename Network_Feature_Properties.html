<h1>Network Feature Properties</h1>
<p>The properties of a network feature include its name, description, and priority. Network feature settings appear at the top of the network feature details page once a network feature is created.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Setting</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Limited to 32 characters. <span>Names cannot be longer than 32 characters and can contain only letters, number, dashes, and underscores.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature Code</td>
<td><span>Must be unique. Consider carefully when creating a feature code. It is used throughout the subscriber provisioning system to identify the network feature and cannot be changed once you create the network feature.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Optional. Gives more details about the network feature. <span>A good description will explain what the network feature is intended to do.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smart Services Enabled</td>
<td>
<p>Determines when the network feature is enforced on devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>On (default): The features, and the policies within it, will be delivered to and enforced on a device when the subscriber is managed by ItsOn. Subscribers are managed by ItsOn when
<ul>
<li>They are using a device that is running the ItsOn embedded client software, and</li>
<li>They have created an account for using the device, and</li>
<li>The subscriber charging system state is "ItsOn Smart Services'"</li>
</ul>
Charging of usage is done by the ItsOn&#160;system.</li>
<li>Off: The features, and the policies within it, will be delivered to and enforced on a device&#160;<span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">when&#160;</span>ItsOn <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">is not managing the subscriber. This can happen in several&#160;cases:</span>
<ul>
<li>Subscriber has not yet created an account.</li>
<li>Subscriber has canceled their ItsOn account.</li>
<li>The subscriber is provisioned by the ItsOn system but the subscriber charging system state is "Legacy system enforced."</li>
</ul>
In these cases, customers and their devices are managed by the carrier's own system. Charging of usage is done by the carrier's system.</li>
</ul>
<div class="info">This switch is only valid on <a hqid="301951" href="#">tenants</a> where subscribers could be managed by either the ItsOn charging system or the tenant's own charging system.</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">Device</span><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">&#160;users can enable/disable this feature</span></td>
<td>Determines <span>whether you want embedded-client device users to have the ability to enable and disable the network feature.&#160;</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Default user state</td>
<td>
<p>Available when <em>Device users can enable/disable this feature</em> is enabled.</p>
<ul>
<li>On: The network feature is enabled when it is pushed to the embedded-client device.</li>
<li>Off (default): The network feature is disabled when it is pushed to the embedded-client device.&#160;</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UX Reference Code</td>
<td>
<p>Defines the way embedded-client device users can enable and disable a network feature when they are allowed to do so. The 2 available options (wifi_auto_accept and connection_optimizer) represent the different options that users will see on their devices, but may not represent the functionality of the network feature that can be enabled/disabled.</p>
<div class="warning">Using more than 2 UX Reference Codes is not supported within the ItsOn Smart Services software. The features that users can enable/disable cannot use the same UX Reference Code. If you require additional functionality, contact Technical Support.</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a name="FeatureSettings-Priority" id="FeatureSettings-Priority"></a>Priority</td>
<td>
<p>Defines&#160;policy priority, which determines what policies take precedence over others. When a usage or other event occurs that matches multiple policies on a device, the priority setting determines which policy's policy event is enforced or which block or intercept notifications are triggered. Lower-priority policies are ignored for that event.</p>
<p>When you assign a priority to a network feature, that priority becomes assigned to all policies within the network feature. If you want policies to have different priorities, put them in different network features. See&#160;<a hqid="232049" href="#">Priority Scenarios</a> for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Created by</td>
<td>The user who created the network feature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Created date</td>
<td>The date the network feature was created.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Status</td>
<td>Network feature status. Can be Draft, Test, or Published.</td>
</tr>
