</ul>
<div class="warning">Gifted products cannot have more than one cycle, because when you purchase a plan, you are purchasing only the first cycle, and gifting a plan with more than 1 cycle would require the gift recipient to either pay for subsequent cycles or cancel the plan before it renews.

<li><em>Gift recipient only</em>, the <strong>Recurring</strong> setting is constrained to <em>No</em>, which means that you cannot create a multi-cycle plan that is giftable only.</li>

<li>Manual: Allocation of any amount of a plan to any subscriber happens manually. When a subscriber joins or is removed from an account or when a plan is exchanged, no automatic (re)allocation occurs.

<ul>
<li>Limited (aka never go below)</li>
<li>Piñata</li>
</ul>
<p>Limited is considered a "hard allocation," which means that once a subscriber is allocated an amount from the plan, no other subscriber can use that allocated amount of the plan unless there is an explicit reallocation. The total of the subscriber allocations cannot exceed 100%. For Limited, the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>A subscriber allowance cannot be changed to lower than what the subscriber has already used in the cycle.</li>
<li>A subscriber allowance cannot be changed to more than what remains in the plan allowance.</li>
<li>The total of all subscriber allowances cannot be more than 100%.</li>
<li>The total of all subscriber allowances can be less than 100%. That is, there can be unallocated plan allowance.</li>
<li>The subscriber allowance percentages that are in place at the end of the cycle carry over to the next cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Piñata is like a large glass with each subscriber having a straw. Each subscriber can consume as much of the total plan allocation as they are allocated, each allocation can be any value up to the plan allocation, and the total of all allocations can be more than 100%. The amount each subscriber actually consumes each cycle is defined only by their usage pattern. For example, you have a shared 100MB data plan. An account with 2 subscribers purchases the plan and gives each subscriber 100%. The first day of the first cycle, subscriber A uses 100MB. Subscriber B's allocation for the rest of the cycle becomes 0MB. In the second cycle, subscriber B uses 100MB in the first day. Subscriber A's allocation for the rest of the cycle becomes 0MB.</p>
<p>For both Limited and Piñata, the total allocation to subscribers can equal less than 100%, so there could be an unallocated amount in a cycle.</p>
<p>See <a hqid="333167" href="#">Sharing Examples</a> for information on how sharing and allocation works.</p>

<li>Reassignable: The plan allocation is available to be used by only one subscriber at once, but it can be assigned and reassigned to any subscriber on the account for the duration of the plan.</li>

<div class="info">Sharing, assigning, and gifting settings all affect what customers can do with plans. See&#160;<a hqid="363927" href="#">Sharing, Assigning, and Gifting</a> for more information on how these settings work together.</div>
<p>There are a number of ways that customers receive plans where sharing, assigning, and gifting settings will not be available to them. In those cases, default plan sharablility and assignability occurs.</p>
<p>Some sharing and assigning is done by the plan purchaser as part of the purchase process. In fact, some settings require sharing, assigning, or gifting selection at purchase time. But when a plan is <a hqid="288845" href="#">mandatory</a> to be received, is received via the complimentary or provisioning API, or is received as a <a hqid="1762747" href="#">benefit</a>, it is not included as a part of such a purchase flow, so sharing and assigning selections that are required within that flow cannot be made.</p>
<p>A specific example of this is if a plan's <strong>Allocation</strong> setting is <em>Assignable</em> and the <strong>Assignment Method</strong> setting is <em>Assignable at purchase only</em>. If the plan is received as a benefit, it doesn't go through that customer-facing purchase flow, and so cannot be assigned. Another example is if a plan's T<strong>his product can be purchased for</strong> setting is <em>Gift recipient only</em>. If this plan was being purchased, the only option at purchase time would be to enter a phone number of a subscriber outside the account to receive the plan. But again, if the plan is received as a complimentary plan, the screen to enter a phone number isn't shown, so there's no way to gift the plan.</p>
<p>The general rule is that if a plan is received outside of the customer-facing purchase flow, like when a plan is received automatically, and has a combination of settings that require decisions only in that customer-facing purchase flow, then the plan is assigned to the subscriber designated to receive the plan, and if that subscriber is not known, the plan is assigned to the first subscriber in the account.</p>
<h3><a name="GeneralTab-ServiceSettings" id="GeneralTab-ServiceSettings"></a>Service Settings</h3>

<td><strong>Service Policy</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Required. Select the service policy from Service Design Center necessary to provide customers the service you offer in the product.</p>
<p>The type of service policy is in parentheses after the service policy names. Make sure you select a</p>
<ul>
<li>voice service policy for voice plans</li>
<li>messaging service policy for text plans</li>
<li>data service policy for data plans</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">If you are not sure which service policy to choose or you do not see the service policy you want to use, contact your service policy designer.</div>
<p>It's important to select the right type of service policy because service policies allow only one type of service. So if you intend to create a voice plan (with a name and a description that suggest voice service) and you accidentally select a messaging service policy (and it gets through all your testing and review), a customer would buy the plan to make voice calls. But when they try to make a voice call using the plan (and if they have no other voice plans that could be used as a fallback), they will be blocked because the policy upon which the plan they do have is based allows only text messaging.</p>

<li>Optional - To give the plan for only one cycle initially, but to include a customer option to subscribe. When customers purchase the plan, they get only one cycle unless they select the option during purchase to subscribe and receive additional cycles. When customers receive the plan in any other way, such as through a benefit, the option to subscribe and receive additional cycles is on the plan details page in the self-service app and on their account page after the plan is received.

<td><strong>Prorated on first cycle</strong></td>

<p>Required. This is proration, and it defines how much is billed and allotted for the first cycle. Available only when <em>Aligned to account cycle</em> is set to Yes.</p>
<div class="info">
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> When you have a plan that has more than one account cycle and aligned to the account cycle, you'll almost always want to set this to <em>Yes</em>. If you set it to <em>No</em>, a customer will be charged full price for the plan even if they buy it on the last day of the account cycle.</p>
<p>While that may be OK for plans with a fixed amount of consumption, your business needs may dictate otherwise, especially for unlimited plans</p>
<p>For example, if if a plan offers 30MB of data for $30/month and a customer whose account cycle begins on the 1st buys the plan of the 20th, they will get a prorated amount of 10MB for a prorated cost of $10. But if you offer an unlimited amount of data for $30/month and a customer whose account cycle begins on the 1st buys the plan on the 30th, they will get an unlimited amount of data for $1. So for unlimited plans, you may want to consider setting this option to <em>No</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>Even when a plan is prorated normally, when it is offered in an exchange category in a carousel and a customer receives the plan through the exchange category in the carousel, no proration occurs. The customer receives the full allotment for the remainder of the cycle in which it is received and is charged the full cycle price.</p>

<td><a name="GeneralTab-BehaviorSettings-UsageDisplay" id="GeneralTab-BehaviorSettings-UsageDisplay"></a><strong>Usage Display</strong></td>
<td>
<p>When customers buy plans, they can view how much they have used of that plan (or how much they have left to use) and how long they have used the plan (or how long they have left to use the plan) in the My Plans section of the self-care app. Plans can have a consumable element (it's allocation, in minutes, messages, or megabytes) and a duration element (how much time is available to use the plan).</p>
<p>The usage display can show the allocation usage, the time usage, or both. The ItsOn system defines a default display of usage, and what's shown for that default depends on other plan settings. You can also define a custom usage display for the plan, which overrides the default. Select:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom: To select what type of usage information your subscribers will see for this plan and how it will be shown. When you select Custom, two additional options become available: Duration and Units. Use these options to configure exactly what users will see on their devices.</li>
<li>Default: To use the default usage display property (defined below) for the type of plan and its configuration.</li>

<h4 id="PlanSettings-SummaryofUsageDisplayOptionDefaults">Summary of Usage Display Defaults</h4>
<p>Usage display defaults depend on your usage and duration choices in the Voice/Messaging/Data Usage and Cycle Duration settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited usage and unlimited duration: summary or name only (no duration or unit bars or labels)</li>
<li>Unlimited usage and limited duration: cycle duration only (duration bar &amp; label, no units bar or label)</li>
<li>Limited usage and unlimited duration: unit data only (units bar &amp; label only, no duration bar or label)</li>
<li>Limited usage and limited duration: unit and duration data (units bar and label and duration bar and label)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bar and Label Direction and Position</h4>
<p>The direction of bar movement and the position of labels in relation to the bar (to the right or left of the bar) depend on tenant settings and/or language (left-to-right or right-to-left) settings.</p>
<p>First, whether the bars are count up (for example, Day 7 of 15 or 300 of 500 Mins) or count down (for example, 8 days remaining or 500 MB remaining) depends on a tenant setting.</p>
<p>Then, the direction that the bar moves (or fills) depends on a tenant setting.</p>
<p>Finally, if there is a label, its location depends on language settings. If the language setting is left-to-right, the label will be to the right of the bar. If the language setting is right-to-left, the label will be to the left of the bar.</p>

<td><strong>Terminates when usage allowance runs out</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Available only when Renewal is <em>Does not renew</em> because this setting is used only for one-time plans. Determines if a plan is terminated when its usage allowance runs out. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes (default): When a plan's usage allowance runs out, the plan is terminated and is moved to the Subscription History or Plan History list immediately.</li>
<li>No: When a plan's usage allowance runs out, the plan remains unterminated and in the Subscriptions or My Plans list until it expires based on the validity duration.</li>
</ul>
<div class="info"><strong>Note:</strong> A reason why you might want to choose No here is so that customers can upgrade one-time plans if the usage allowance runs out before its expiration. Once a plan terminates, it can't be upgraded.</div>
<p>This is how a depleted plan would look when you select No:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/usage_plan_depleted.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>The choice here can also affect when <a hqid="288842" href="#">intercept notifications</a> are triggered. One of the intercept notification rule options is a reason, and the two choices are <em>Plan Capped</em> and <em>Plan Not Present</em>. If a plan terminates, then it would match the <em>Plan Not Present</em> option in the notification. If a plan is not terminated when its allocation runs out (the <em>No</em> option of this setting), the plan would still be considered active until its duration expires. This matches the <em>Plan Capped</em> intercept notification option, and you could design an intercept notification to provide easy upgrade options.</p>

<td><strong>Visibility</strong></td>

<p>Determines whether or not the plan is visible to customers.</p>
<p>If this is set to <em>Hide</em>, the plan is not visible for purchase in the store nor is it visible in a customer's account information. It is not shown as part of a <a hqid="288804" href="#">bundle</a> when included in a bundle, and usage and intercept <a hqid="288853" href="#">notifications</a> are not triggered by hidden plans. For more on how hidden plans work in bundles, see <a hqid="288841" href="#">Hidden Products in Bundles</a>.</p>
<div class="warning">A plan cannot be hidden unless its price is equal to 0 (zero). This is because at checkout, a non-zero priced plan in the cart will result in a total price that is different from the sum of the prices of the visible products, which could cause customer confusion. So this setting is unavailable until a price value greater than 0 (zero) has been entered for the plan.</div>

<p>When a customer is viewing the catalog, both the sale price and the retail price are visible in the product listing. The exact appearance will depend on your branding. The following graphic is an example of what customers might see in a product where the Retail Price is 1.00 and the Sale Price is 0.80:</p>
<p><img src="images/client_sale_price.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<div class="info">Some research suggests that consumers believe prices with more syllables are higher than the same prices with fewer syllables, and this is seen in both spoken and printed prices. Both commas and decimal points add to the "syllables," so, for example, $1,199.00 is viewed as more than $1199. ItsOn provides a client-side branding setting that can present catalog prices without the decimal and the digits after the decimal for whole number prices. If this setting were used for the example above, the values seen in the catalog presentation would be $1 and $0.80. This setting does not affect the amounts you enter in the Retail Price Price or the Sale Price fields, nor the amounts shown during checkout, in customer invoices, and in customer service records.</div>
