</table>
<p>There are a number of ways that customers receive entitlements where sharing, assigning, and gifting settings will not be available to them. In those cases, default entitlement sharablility and assignability occurs.</p>
<p>Some sharing and assigning is done by the entitlement purchaser as part of the purchase process. In fact, some settings require sharing, assigning, or gifting selection at purchase time. But when an entitlement is <a href="#">mandatory</a> to be received, is received via the complimentary or provisioning API, or is received as a <a href="#">benefit</a>, it is not included as a part of such a purchase flow, so sharing and assigning selections that are required within that flow cannot be made.</p>
<p>A specific example of this is if an entitlement's <strong>Allocation</strong> setting is <em>Assignable</em> and the <strong>Assignment Method</strong> setting is <em>Assignable at purchase only</em>. If the entitlement is received as a benefit, it doesn't go through that customer-facing purchase flow, and so cannot be assigned. Another example is if an entitlement's T<strong>his product can be purchased for</strong> setting is <em>Gift recipient only</em>. If this entitlement was being purchased, the only option at purchase time would be to enter a phone number of a subscriber outside the account to receive the entitlement. But again, if the entitlement is received as a complimentary entitlement, the screen to enter a phone number isn't shown, so there's no way to gift the entitlement.</p>
<p>The general rule is that if an entitlement is received outside of the customer-facing purchase flow, like when an entitlement is received automatically, and has a combination of settings that require decisions only in that customer-facing purchase flow, then the entitlement is assigned to the subscriber designated to receive the entitlement, and if that subscriber is not known, the entitlement is assigned to the first subscriber in the account.</p>
<h3><a name="GeneralTab-ServiceSettings" id="GeneralTab-ServiceSettings"></a>Service Settings</h3>
<p>These settings define which entitlement policy is used in the product.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Setting</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Entitlement Policy</strong></td>
<td>
<p style="line-height: 19.6px;">Required. Select the <a href="#">entitlement policy</a>&#160;necessary to provide customers the functionality you control in the entitlement product.</p>
<div class="warning">If you are not sure which entitlement policy to choose or you do not see the entitlement policy you want to use, contact your entitlement policy designer.</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>State</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Determines whether or not the entitlement product functionality is enabled or disabled when received. Select from:</p>
<ul>
<li>On (default): The entitlement product functionality is enabled.</li>
<li>Off: The entitlement product functionality is disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, you will want to leave this setting in its default value because you want subscribers that receive the entitlement product to be able to use its functionality. But setting the state to Off may be desired when the entitlement product is part of a bundle and the bundle is in an exchange category. An example may illustrate this best.</p>
<p>Say you have an entitlement product to allow subscribers to use hotspots. You want to bundle the hotspot functionality with several plans that you have in an exchange category. You have 1-line plans, 2-line plans, 3-line plans, etc. You want the hotspot functionality to be enabled for subscribers only when a 2-line (or greater) plan is purchased. You can't just add the entitlement product only to the bundles that are 2 lines or more because that will will create exchangeability issues. (Bundle exchanges within an exchange category are allowed only between bundles that have the same number of products that use the same policies.) So you create 2 entitlement products. Both use the same entitlement policy. The one with the State value of Off you bundle with the 1-line plan and the one with the State value of On you bundle with the other plans.</p>

<div class="warning">If you selected <em>Giftable only</em> in the <strong>This product can be purchased for</strong> setting, the only option here is No. This is because entitlement products that are gifted can have only one cycle because when you purchase an entitlement product, you are purchasing only the first cycle, and gifting an entitlement product with more than 1 cycle would require the gift recipient to either pay for subsequent cycles or cancel the entitlement product before it renews.</div>
<p>Select:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes - To allow the entitlement product to have as many cycles as defined in <em>Number of Cycles</em>. Once a customer receives the entitlement product, it continues to renew until it is canceled.</li>
<li>No - To restrict the entitlement product to just one cycle.</li>
<li>Optional - To give the entitlement product for only one cycle initially, but to include a customer option to subscribe. When customers purchase the entitlement product, they get only one cycle unless they select the option during purchase to subscribe and receive additional cycles. When customers receive the entitlement product in any other way, such as through a benefit, the option to subscribe and receive additional cycles is on the entitlement product details page in the self-service app and on their account page after the plan is received. The <em>Number of Cycles</em> setting determines the maximum amount of times the customer can receive the product subscription.<br />
<br />
During any last cycle (which is also the first cycle at purchase time or at the time the entitlement product is received, such as from a benefit), customers have the option to toggle renewability. In other words, during the entitlement product's last cycle, customers can decide that they want to continue receiving and paying for the entitlement product up to the <em>Number of Cycles</em>. Customers can also stop entitlement product renewal during any last cycle, in which case the entitlement product terminates at the end of the current cycle.</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">Any segmentation rules that include this setting, including restrictions and offers, will treat both <em>Yes</em> and <em>Optional</em> as the same. That is, if a rule is defined to match a recurring product, the rule will match if this setting for the product is either <em>Yes</em> or <em>Optional</em>.</div>

<p>Required. This defines the number of cycles a subscriber can receive the entitlement. The options determine if an entitlement repeats at the end of its duration. (The duration is defined either as the account cycle, if <em>Aligned to account cycle</em> is Yes, or as the entitlement's <em>Cycle Duration</em> value.) If so, the customer is grandfathered the entitlement rate and attributes when it is renewed, even if you have made <a href="#">significant changes</a> to the entitlement or even deleted it from your catalog. Select from:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Entitlements renew when they are set to an unlimited number of cycles or when they are "limited" to more than one cycle, that is, the number in the <em>Limited to</em> option is greater than 1. Renewing means that at the end of a entitlement cycle's duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cycle starts over.</li>
<li>Billing occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to make the entitlement <a href="#PlanSettings-TypeSettings-Giftable">giftable</a>, then it cannot renew and you must select the <em>Limited to</em> option and enter 1. This is because when you purchase an entitlement, you are paying only for the first cycle.

<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> When you have an entitlement that has more than one cycle and is aligned to the account cycle, you'll almost always want to set this to <em>Yes</em>.

<div class="warning">An entitlement product cannot be hidden unless its price is equal to 0 (zero).

<p>When a customer is viewing the catalog, both the sale price and the retail price are visible in the product listing. The exact appearance will depend on your branding.

<div class="info">Some research suggests that consumers believe prices with more syllables are higher than the same prices with fewer syllables, and this is seen in both spoken and printed prices. Both commas and decimal points add to the "syllables," so, for example, $1,199.00 is viewed as more than $1199. ItsOn provides a client-side branding setting that can present catalog prices without the decimal and the digits after the decimal for whole number prices. If this setting were used for the example above, the values seen in the catalog presentation would be $1 and $0.80. This setting does not affect the amounts you enter in the Retail Price Price or the Sale Price fields, nor the amounts shown during checkout, in customer invoices, and in customer service records.</div>
