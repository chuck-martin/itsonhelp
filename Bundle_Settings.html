<div class="info"><strong>Best Practice:</strong> The bundle description is information that subscribers will see in the store before purchase (for basic and compound bundles) and on their account pages after purchase (for compound bundles). It is a good place to summarize information about all the plans and fees you put in the bundle so they can see at a glance what they are getting in the bundle.</div>
<p>Depending on what types of plans and fees are in the bundle, you may also want to provide short summaries of each. For example:</p>
<ul>

<li>250 messages text plan</li>
<li>100MB data plan</li>
<li>10MB Facebook plan that lasts 10 days</li>

<p>Bundle: The bundle price is determined by the amount entered in the Billing section.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>When you use bundle pricing for basic bundles and the basic bundle contains products that renew, the renewal price of each product is proportional to the bundle price and is not the product's defined price.</p>
<p>For example, you have 2 renewable plans in a bundle. Plan 1 costs $20 and Plan 2 costs $10. You give the bundle a price of $15, which is half the total price of the plans if they were bought individually. A customer who buys the bundle can renew one or both plans. The renewal cost for Plan 1 would be $10 and the renewal cost for Plan 2 would be $5.</p>

</li>
<li>Manual: Allocation of any amount of a plan in the compound bundle to any subscriber happens manually.

<ul>
<li>Limited (aka never go below)</li>
<li>Piñata</li>
</ul>
<p>Limited is considered a "hard allocation," which means that once a subscriber is allocated an amount from a product, no other subscriber can use that allocated amount of that product unless there is an explicit reallocation. The total of the subscriber allocations cannot exceed 100%. For Limited, the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>A subscriber allowance cannot be changed to lower than what the subscriber has already used in the cycle.</li>
<li>A subscriber allowance cannot be changed to more than what remains in the product allowance.</li>
<li>The total of all subscriber allowances cannot be more than 100%.</li>
<li>The total of all subscriber allowances can be less than 100%. That is, there can be unallocated product allowance.</li>
<li>The subscriber allowance percentages that are in place at the end of the cycle carry over to the next cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Piñata is like a large glass with each subscriber having a straw. Each subscriber can consume as much of the total plan allocation as they are allocated, each allocation can be any value up to the plan allocation, and the total of all allocations can be more than 100%. The amount each subscriber actually consumes each cycle is defined only by their usage pattern. For example, you have a shared 100MB data plan. An account with 2 subscribers purchases the plan and gives each subscriber 100%. The first day of the first cycle, subscriber A uses 100MB. Subscriber B's allocation for the rest of the cycle becomes 0MB. In the second cycle, subscriber B uses 100MB in the first day. Subscriber A's allocation for the rest of the cycle becomes 0MB.</p>
<p>For both Limited and Piñata, the total allocation to subscribers can equal less than 100%, so there could be an unallocated amount in a cycle.</p>
<p>See <a href="#">Sharing Examples</a> for information on how sharing and allocation works.</p>
<div class="info">The Share Type option is viable only when the <a href="#">tenant</a> offers more than one type of sharing.</div>

<td style="padding-left: 1px; padding-top: 1px; padding-right: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px;">
<p>When <em>Assignable</em> is selected as the <strong>Allocation</strong> setting, determines how that assignment occurs. Select:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignable at purchase only: The allocation of the products in the compound bundle is available to be used by only one subscriber at once. The allocation of each product in the compound bundle can be assigned one time, at purchase time only, to one other subscriber (including the purchaser), at which point that is the only subscriber that can use the product allocation.</li>
<li>Reassignable: The allocation of each product in the compound bundle is available to be used by only one subscriber at once, but it can be assigned and reassigned to any subscriber in the account for the duration of the compound bundle.</li>

<div class="info">Sharing, assigning, and gifting settings all affect what customers can do with plans. See&#160;<a href="#">Sharing, Assigning, and Gifting</a> for more information on how these settings work together.</div>
<p>There are a number of ways that customers receive bundles where sharing, assigning, and gifting settings will not be available to them. In those cases, default bundle sharablility and assignability occurs.</p>
<p>Some sharing and assigning is done by the bundle purchaser as part of the purchase process. In fact, some settings require sharing, assigning, or gifting selection at purchase time. But when a bundle is <a href="#">mandatory</a> to be received, is received via the complimentary or provisioning API, or is received as a <a href="#">benefit</a>, it is not included as a part of such a purchase flow, so sharing and assigning selections that are required within that flow cannot be made.</p>
<p>A specific example of this is if a bundle's <strong>Allocation</strong> setting is <em>Assignable</em> and the <strong>Assignment Method</strong> setting is <em>Assignable at purchase only</em>. If the bundle is received as a benefit, it doesn't go through that customer-facing purchase flow, and so cannot be assigned. Another example is if a bundle's T<strong>his product can be purchased for</strong> setting is <em>Gift recipient only</em>. If this bundle was being purchased, the only option at purchase time would be to enter a phone number of a subscriber outside the account to receive the bundle. But again, if the bundle is received as a complimentary bundle, the screen to enter a phone number isn't shown, so there's no way to gift the bundle.</p>
<p>The general rule is that if a bundle is received outside of the customer-facing purchase flow, like when a bundle is received automatically, and has a combination of settings that require decisions only in that customer-facing purchase flow, then the bundle is assigned to the subscriber designated to receive the bundle, and if that subscriber is not known, the bundle is assigned to the first subscriber in the account.</p>
<h3><a name="GeneralTab-BehaviorSettings" id="GeneralTab-BehaviorSettings"></a>Behavior Settings</h3>
<div class="warning">Behavior settings are used only for compound bundles. In compound bundles, these settings override the individual product settings.</div>
<p>These settings determine how and when a compound bundle is available in the store. See&#160;<a href="#">Plan Behavior Settings Examples</a>&#160;for some scenarios on how these settings combine to produce desired product behavior.&#160;</p>
<p>Several of the behavior settings relate to aspects of the plan cycle, aspects that include:</p>

<li>Number of cycles</li>
<li>Cycle alignment</li>
<li>Cycle duration</li>
<li>Cycle proration</li>

<p>Required. Defines whether the bundle is a multi-cycle subscription, lasts for only one cycle, or lasts for one cycle with the option for customers to renew.</p>
<div class="warning">If you selected <em>Giftable only</em> in the <strong>This product can be purchased for</strong> setting, the only option here is No. This is because bundles that are gifted can have only one cycle because when you purchase a bundle, you are purchasing only the first cycle, and gifting a bundle with more than 1 cycle would require the gift recipient to either pay for subsequent cycles or cancel the bundle before it renews.</div>
<p>Select:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes - To allow the bundle to have as many cycles as defined in <em>Number of Cycles</em>. Once a customer receives the bundle, it continues to renew until it is canceled.</li>
<li>No - To restrict the bundle to just one cycle.</li>
<li>Optional - To give the bundle for only one cycle initially, but to include a customer option to subscribe. When customers purchase the bundle, they get only one cycle unless they select the option during purchase to subscribe and receive additional cycles. When customers receive the bundle in any other way, such as through a benefit, the option to subscribe and receive additional cycles is on the bundle details page in the self-service app and on their account page after the bundle is received. The <em>Number of Cycles</em> setting determines the maximum amount of times the customer can receive the product subscription.<br />
<br />
During any last cycle (which is also the first cycle at purchase time or at the time the bundle is received, such as from a benefit), customers have the option to toggle renewability. In other words, during the bundle's last cycle, customers can decide that they want to continue receiving and paying for the bundle up to the <em>Number of Cycles</em>. Customers can also stop bundle renewal during any last cycle, in which case the bundle terminates at the end of the current cycle.</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">Any segmentation rules that include this setting, including restrictions and offers, will treat both <em>Yes</em> and <em>Optional</em> as the same. That is, if a rule is defined to match a recurring product, the rule will match if this setting for the product is either <em>Yes</em> or <em>Optional</em>.</div>

(The duration is defined either as the account cycle, if <strong>Aligned to account cycle</strong> is <em>Yes</em>, or as the compound bundle's <strong>Cycle Duration</strong> value.) If so, the customer is grandfathered the compound bundle rate and attributes when it is renewed, even if you have made <a href="#">significant changes</a> to the compound bundle or even deleted it from your catalog. Select from:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Compound bundles renew when they are set to an unlimited number of cycles or when they are "limited" to more than one cycle, that is, the number in the <em>Limited to</em> option is greater than 1. Renewing means that at the end of a compound bundle cycle's duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The usage counter is reset.</li>
<li>The cycle starts over.</li>
<li>Billing occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are going to make the compound bundle <a href="#PlanSettings-TypeSettings-Giftable">giftable</a>, then it cannot renew and you must select the <em>Limited to</em> option and enter 1. This is because when you purchase a compound bundle, you are paying only for the first cycle.

<p>While that may be OK for compound bundles with a fixed amount of consumption, your business needs may dictate otherwise, especially for compound bundles with unlimited plans</p>
<p>For example, if if a plan in a compound bundle offers 30MB of data for $30/month and a customer whose account cycle begins on the 1st buys the plan of the 20th, they will get a prorated amount of 10MB for a prorated cost of $10. But if you offer an unlimited amount of data for $30/month and a customer whose account cycle begins on the 1st buys the plan on the 30th, they will get an unlimited amount of data for $1. So if you have unlimited plans in he compound bundle, you may want to consider setting this option to <em>No</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>Even when a compound bundle is prorated normally, when it is offered in an exchange category in a carousel and a customer receives the compound bundle through the exchange category in the carousel, no proration occurs. The customer receives the full allotment for the remainder of the cycle in which it is received and is charged the full cycle price.</p>

<td><strong>Terminates when all product usage allowances run out</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Available only when <strong>Number of Cycles</strong> is set to <em>Limited to</em> and its value is 1 because this setting is used only for one-time compound bundles. Determines if a compound bundle is terminated when the usage allowance of all the plans in the compound bundle run out. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes (default): When the usage allowance of all plans in a compound bundle run out, the compound bundle is terminated and is moved to the Subscription History or Plan History list immediately.</li>
<li>No: When the usage allowance of all plans in a compound bundle run out, the compound bundle remains unterminated and in the Subscriptions or My Plans list until it expires based on the validity duration.</li>
</ul>
<div class="info"><strong>Note:</strong> A reason why you might want to choose No here is so that customers can upgrade one-time compound bundles if the usage allowance of all its plans run out before the expiration of the compound bundle. Once a compound bundle terminates, it can't be upgraded.</div>
<p>The choice here can also affect when <a href="#">intercept notifications</a> are triggered. One of the intercept notification rule options is a reason, and the two choices are <em>Plan Capped</em> and <em>Plan Not Present</em>. If a bundle terminates, then it would match the <em>Plan Not Present</em> option in the notification. If a bundle is not terminated when the usage allowance of all the plans in the bundle run out (the <em>No</em> option of this setting), the bundle would still be considered active until its duration expires. This matches the <em>Plan Capped</em> intercept notification option, and you could design an intercept notification to provide easy upgrade options.</p>

<td><strong>Visibility</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Determines whether or not the compound bundle is visible to customers.</p>
<p>If this is set to <em>Hide</em>, the bundle is not visible for purchase in the store nor is it visible in a customer's account information. It is not shown as part of a <a href="#">bundle</a> when included in another bundle, and usage&#160;<a href="#">notifications</a> are not triggered by plans within a hidden bundle, regardless of the visibility setting of the plans.</p>
<div class="warning">A bundle cannot be hidden unless its price is equal to 0 (zero). This is because at checkout, a non-zero priced bundle in the cart will result in a total price that is different from the sum of the prices of the visible products, which could cause customer confusion. So this setting is unavailable until a price value greater than 0 (zero) has been entered for the bundle.</div>

<h4>Bar and Label Direction and Position</h4>
<p>The direction of bar movement and the position of labels in relation to the bar (to the right or left of the bar) depend on tenant settings and/or language (left-to-right or right-to-left) settings.</p>
<p>First, whether the bars are count up (for example, Day 7 of 15) or count down (for example, 8 days remaining) depends on a tenant setting.</p>
<p>Then, the direction that the bar moves (or fills) depends on a tenant setting.</p>
<p>Finally, if there is a label, its location depends on language settings. If the language setting is left-to-right, the label will be to the right of the bar. If the language setting is right-to-left, the label will be to the left of the bar.</p>

<p>When a customer is viewing the catalog, both the sale price and the retail price are visible in the product listing. The exact appearance will depend on your branding. The following graphic is an example of what customers might see in a product where the Retail Price is 1.00 and the Sale Price is 0.80:</p>
<p><img src="images/client_sale_price.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" width="204" height="69" border="1" /></p>
<div class="info">Some research suggests that consumers believe prices with more syllables are higher than the same prices with fewer syllables, and this is seen in both spoken and printed prices. Both commas and decimal points add to the "syllables," so, for example, $1,199.00 is viewed as more than $1199. ItsOn provides a client-side branding setting that can present catalog prices without the decimal and the digits after the decimal for whole number prices. If this setting were used for the example above, the values seen in the catalog presentation would be $1 and $0.80. This setting does not affect the amounts you enter in the Retail Price Price or the Sale Price fields, nor the amounts shown during checkout, in customer invoices, and in customer service records.</div>

<h4 class="title">Taxes and Bundles</h4>
<div class="message-content">
<p>Unlike with plans and fees, you do not set a tax type with bundles. Taxes are charged based on the tax settings of the products within a bundle.</p>
<p>However, bundles are taxed based on the relative proportion of the retail price of their parts applied to the bundle price. For example, let's say you have a voice plan (P1) and a Messaging Plan (M1) and the tax rate on both is 5%. You charge $6 for the voice plan and $4 for the messaging plan, and you put them both in a bundle that you charge $8 for.</p>
<p>If bought individually, the tax for P1 would be $0.30 and the tax for M1 would be $0.20. Total taxes for the 2 products is $0.50.</p>
<p>The proportional cost for P1 in the bundle is $6/($6 + $4) = 60% * $8 = $4.80. Tax would be $0.24.</p>
<p>The proportional cost for M1 in the bundle is $4/($6 + $4) = 40% * 8 = $3.20. Tax would be $0.16.</p>
<p>Total tax for the bundle is $0.40.</p>
