<h1>Feature a Product</h1>
<p>Products can be featured in two types of places, on the store category pages and on non-store pages in the ItsOn self-care app and the web portal. To feature a product, the banner graphic must be defined in the Media tab of that product. See <a href="#PlanSettings-MediaTab">Product Settings</a> for details.</p>
<div>
<div class="warning">
<p>Service Design Center&#160;uses a change management process to track and approve all changes to any product. All of these changes, including additions, edits, and deletions, must go through the <a hqid="288799" href="#">promote</a>-<a hqid="288800" href="#">approve-deploy</a> process before they become available.</p>
<p>Any changes you make (change a name, change a price, add or delete a product from a bundle, etc.) to any product do not affect any users that already have the product.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Feature a Product On a Store Category Page</h2>
<p>When viewed in the store, products are displayed within containers that typically appear as tabs. You can feature one or more products within each tab, which makes the featured product appear as a rotating banner with other featured products at the top of the tab, and products can be featured in more than one tab.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the&#160;<a hqid="288880" href="#">Sandbox</a>&#160;view you want to work in. Hover over the down arrow next to the current sandbox name in the header, then click a sandbox name.</li>
<li>Go to&#160;<strong>Catalog &gt; Categories</strong>.</li>
<li>Click a category that is one of your store tabs.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Marketing</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the Featured Products section, click <strong>Add</strong>.<br />
The product that you select to be featured does not have to be a product in any <a hqid="288808" href="#">category</a>, specifically, it does not have to be in a <a hqid="298180" href="#">category for displaying plans in the store</a>. When customers tap on the banner image, they will be taken directly to the featured product's details page.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.&#160;</li>
</ol>
<p>To add additional products to the store tab category, repeat steps 5 through 7.</p>
<h2>Feature a Product On a Non-Store Page</h2>
<p>A non-store page is any page in the ItsOn self-care app and web portal that is not a store page.</p>
<div class="prerequisite">
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Before you start this task, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the location in the self-care app where you want the banner for the featured product to appear, both the page and the location on the page.</li>
<li>Work with the team that customizes your versions of the ItsOn self-care app and have them define a layout component for that location and a unique identifier for that layout component. (Some call this your "branding framework.") That identifier:
<ul>
<li>Must begin with /BANNERS</li>
<li>Must be unique</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use this identifier in step 7 of the procedure below</li>
</ol>
<div class="info"><strong>Best Practice</strong>: Work with your branding team to organize the URLs to add information about the location of the banner graphics used for those featured products and to create unique URLs for each layout component location. For example, if your branding framework has defined a location under the fund amount on the account's Billing page, you could just create a URL like <code>/BANNERS/accountfunds</code>, but a URL that better identifies the layout component location, such as <code>/BANNERS/billing/funds/accountfunds</code>, will help you better manage your featured products.</div>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Select the&#160;<a href="#">Sandbox</a>&#160;view you want to work in. Hover over the down arrow next to the current sandbox name in the header, then click a sandbox name.</li>
<li>Go to&#160;<strong>Catalog &gt; Categories</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add Category</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Category</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a meaningful Name.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Override URL</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a URL that begins with /BANNERS that is the identifier of the layout component.
<div class="info"><strong>Best Practice</strong>: This URL should not be the same as the one in any other /BANNERS sub-category (and it should not be just /BANNERS). You should strive for a unique URL identifier for each layout component, and then have it be the URL setting for a unique /BANNERS sub-category.</div>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Marketing</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the Featured Products section, click <strong>Add</strong>.<br />
The product that you select to be featured does not have to be any product in any <a hqid="288808" href="#">category</a>, specifically, it does not have to be in a <a hqid="298180" href="#">category for displaying plans in the store</a>. When customers tap on the banner image, they will be taken directly to the featured product's details page.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.&#160;</li>
<li>Go back to the Categories list and <a hqid="288825" href="#">edit</a> the /BANNERS category (the category that has just /BANNERS in its URL field.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> in the All Child Categories list.</li>
<li>Click the name of the category you just created. This makes it a sub-category of the /BANNERS category.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add additional products to the display of featured products at the location of the layout component, repeat steps 9 through 11 in the sub-category.</p>
