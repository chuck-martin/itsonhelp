<h1>Changes to Products in Exchange Categories</h1>
<p>Products in carousel <a hqid="288807" href="#">exchange categories</a> must be compatible so customers always have the opportunity to exchange one product in the category for another. Service Design Center enforces this compatibility whenever you <a hqid="288860" href="#">promote a change</a> that includes a change to a carousel exchange category, including after you have added any product to a carousel exchange category or made any change to any product already in a carousel exchange category. If a promotion contains an incompatible change in a carousel exchange category, the entire promotion will not occur and you will see an error message.</p>
<p>If you want to make changes in a carousel exchange category that will break compatibility, you must first delete the existing carousel exchange category and then create a new one.</p>
<p>Changing any of the following <a href="#">plan</a> or <a href="#">bundle</a> settings of a product that is in a carousel exchange category to make the settings different from other products in that carousel exchange category causes the plan or bundle to become incompatible. This will cause an error to occur when promoting that change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Policy</li>
<li>Customer can buy for</li>
<li>Share Method</li>
<li>Share Type</li>
<li>Assignment Method</li>
<li>Number of cycles</li>
<li>Aligned to account cycle?</li>
<li>Cycle Duration (plans only)</li>
<li>Bundle cycle length (bundles only)</li>
<li>Prorated on first cycle?</li>
<li>Visibility</li>
<li>The number of plans in the Sku Bundle Items list changes (bundles only)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you delete a carousel exchange category, any customers who have any plans that were in that category keep those plans. However, those plans are no longer directly exchangeable and they are moved into the appropriate sections on the tab that lists a customer's plans.</p>
<p>If you remove a plan or bundle that is in a carousel exchange category from the product list of the carousel exchange category or if you delete a plan or bundle that is in a carousel exchange category from the catalog completely, customers who have that plan or bundle will keep that plan or bundle and will continue to be able to exchange that plan or bundle for other plans or bundles in the carousel exchange category. However, customers who do exchange from a plan or bundle that has been removed from the carousel exchange category or deleted from the catalog will no longer see that plan or bundle in the carousel exchange category once the exchange is complete.</p>
