<h1>Sharing, Assigning, and Gifting</h1>
<p>Some products have settings that allow them to be shared (automatically or on request), assigned (once or indefinitely), and gifted. To understand how gifting works with sharing and assignment settings, it's important to understand the difference between assignable and giftable.</p>
<h2>What's the Difference Between Assignable and Giftable?</h2>
<div class="tip">Both assignable and giftable are ways to transfer products. The difference is in how and when.</div>
<p>The <em>Assignable</em> option in the <strong>Allocation</strong> setting allow transfers to subscribers in the same account and enables the <strong>Assignment Method</strong> setting, which has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Assignable at purchase time only -</em> a single transfer at purchase time</li>
<li><em>Reassiagnable</em> - unlimited transfers at any time</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a product that is reassignable is purchased or otherwise received, the product can be assigned to any other subscriber in the account at any time, which means that a product could potentially be moved from subscriber to subscriber to subscriber, etc., all within one account, until all plan allocation is depleted or the product's duration ends.</p>
<p>Giftability is enabled by 2 options in the <strong>This product can be purchased for</strong> setting, <em>Gift recipient only</em> and <em>Customer's account or gift recipient</em>. These gifting options allow a transfer to a subscriber in any account other than the purchaser's. A product can be gifted only at purchase time by the customer purchasing the product.</p>
<h2>How Do the Sharing, Assignment, and Gifting Settings Work Together?</h2>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Allocation</th>
<th scope="col">Share Method</th>
<th scope="col">Assignment Method</th>
<th scope="col">Plan/Compound Bundle Behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Shareable</td>
<td>Automatic</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>The allocation of the gifted plan or the allocations of all the plans in the gifted bundle is shared automatically among all the subscribers in the account of the gift recipient. (See <a hqid="333167" href="#">Sharing Examples</a> for more information on how allocations are shared.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shareable</td>
<td>Manual</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>The subscriber of the gifted plan or compound bundle receives all of the allowance. The allowance can be shared with other subscribers in the account of the gift recipient on request. (See <a hqid="333167" href="#">Sharing Examples</a> for more information on how allocations are shared.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assignable</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>Assignable at purchase only</td>
<td>Only the subscriber who receives the gifted plan or compound bundle can use it. The act of gifting equals the one assignment allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Assignable</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>Reassignable</td>
<td>The gift is automatically assigned to the giftee. However, it can be assigned to any subscriber in the account at any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exclusive</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>Only the subscriber who receives the gifted plan or compound bundle can use it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>No matter what the <strong>Allocation</strong> setting, the following is always true when a product is giftable:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be gifted only at purchase time.</li>
<li>The gifter loses all control of the product once it is gifted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a product is gifted, its behavior depends on the shareable/assignable setting.</p>
