<h1>Create a Favorites Plan</h1>
<p>Favorites plans, sometimes known as calling circle plans, allow you to give your customers preferred calling rates to a limited amount of numbers.&#160;</p>
<div class="info">Before you begin, make sure you are familiar with the entire process of <a hqid="284774" href="#">creating a basic plan</a>. Much of what you do here will build on what you learned there.</div>
<h2>Idea and Planning</h2>
<p>In this example scenario, you want to create a plan with the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers can choose&#160;up to three preferred destination numbers.</li>
<li>For each of those numbers, customers can call each one for up to 5 minutes for free.</li>
<li>The cumulative amount of time per plan cycle that customers can have for these preferred calls is 100 minutes.</li>
<li>You want to notify customers during a preferred destination call to let them know&#160;when their preferred rate time is running out.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specifics of the plan you create, of course, will likely be different.</p>
<p>The general steps to creating a favorites plan that includes a notification:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the behavior policy.</li>
<li>Create the feature.</li>
<li><a hqid="232078" href="#">Test</a> and <a hqid="232067" href="#">publish</a> the feature.</li>
<li>Create the plan.</li>
<li><a hqid="288860" href="#">Promote</a>, <a hqid="288887" href="#">test</a>, <a hqid="288799" href="#">approve, and deploy</a> the plan.</li>
<li>Create the notification body.</li>
<li><a hqid="288838" href="#">Finalize</a> the notification body.</li>
<li>Create the notification.</li>
<li><a hqid="288860" href="#">Promote</a>, <a hqid="288884" href="#">test</a>, <a hqid="288799" href="#">approve, and deploy</a> the notification.</li>
</ol>
<p>This tutorial topic will show you&#160;the settings for each step that you have to enter that will result in a working favorites plan that your customers can buy.</p>
<h2>Create the Behavior Policy</h2>
<p>A service policy for favorites contains a behavior policy in its filter. So before you can create the feature that contains the service policy for this plan, you have to <a hqid="265680" href="#">create the behavior policy</a>. Start by going to the Behavior Policies page.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_Policy_Behavior_Policy.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>New</strong> to see the Add Behavior Policy dialog box.</p>
<p><img src="images/dialog_Add_Behavior_Policy_3_favorites_5_minutes.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>To start with, we give it a name that will make it easy to find: 3 Favorites 5 Minutes.</p>
<p>You can read more details about <a hqid="265687" href="#">behavior policy settings</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>Probably the most difficult thing to do is to fill in the <em>Allowable Phone Number</em> field. What you enter in this field is a regular expression, sometimes known as a RegEx.</p>
<p>A regular expression is a construct common in programming that matches patterns. For our purposes here, we want to keep this as simple as possible. So we will enter a regular expression that matches any phone number: <code>^[0-9+\(\)#\.\s\/ext-]+$</code></p>
<p>This regular expression does the job in a very basic form. It doesn't specify&#160;how many digits a phone number should have or what numbers are valid for any of the digits. It only verifies that what gets entered in a favorites field contains only the following:&#160;digits, parentheses, dashes, plus sign, space, pound sign, asterisk, period, comma, and the letters e, x, and t. It is beyond this topic to explain how this works, but there are many, many resources to not only explain regular expressions, but to provide regular expression recipes for many, many purposes.</p>
<p>In the <em>Maximum Number of Faves</em>&#160;drop-down list, select 3, because that's how many favorites we want our customers to have.</p>
<div class="warning">When you're planning to use a behavior policy, make sure you are comfortable with the number you want to allow. Once you add the behavior to a filter and the policy containing the filter is published, the only change you can make to this number is to increase it.</div>
<p>For <em>Behavior Allowed</em>, select all the check boxes. You don't want to restrict&#160;the actions your customers can take.</p>
<div class="info">While you want to allow your customers the ability to change their&#160;favorites numbers, you don't want them to be able to swap numbers in and out at will, "gaming" the system. To prevent this, you will typically want to charge a fee for changes. You decide what they will be able to do here, and decide how much you will charge elsewhere.</div>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong> and you're done with this part.&#160;</p>
<h2>Create the Feature</h2>
<p>As with <a hqid="284774" href="#">creating a basic plan</a>, you first need to <a hqid="232005" href="#">create a purchasable feature</a> with a voice service policy. It's the service policy in the feature that gets used by the plan.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/menu_Policy_Features.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" />&#160;<img alt="" src="images/menu_Create_New_Feature_Purchasable.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" />&#160;<img alt="" src="images/dialog_Add_Feature.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>To make sure we can find the feature, we'll give it a descriptive name: 3 Favorites 5&#160;Minutes.</p>
<h3>Set the Feature Priority</h3>
<p>When you offer a plan such as this, it's very likely that your customers will also have one or more other voice plans. You want to make sure that when appropriate, that is, when a customer uses a preferred destination, that the plan that uses the service policy in this feature is used instead of a different plan.</p>
<p>After you click Save in the Add Feature dialog box, make sure you set a priority&#160;for the feature that's higher than the priority of other features that have voice service policies. See&#160;<a hqid="232050" href="#">Feature Settings</a>&#160;for more details about feature priorities.</p>
<p>Like with the basic plan, we'll <a hqid="232010" href="#">add a voice policy</a>, in that voice policy, we'll <a hqid="232002" href="#">add a component</a>, and in that component, we'll <a hqid="232006" href="#">add a filter</a>. All of these will have the same name as the feature.</p>
<p>This time, we're going to add a filter criteria.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_Add_Criteria_Filter_by_Behavior_Policy.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>Once you add the filter, then you add the behavior policy.</p>
<p><img src="images/dialog_Add_Voice_Filter_add_behavior_policy.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>Because there is only one behavior policy, it is added automatically.</p>
<p><img src="images/dialog_Add_Voice_Filter_3_favorites_5_minutes.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>As with the basic plan, we <a hqid="232009" href="#">add a policy event</a>. At this point, we're done with the feature, so we test and publish it.</p>
<h2>Create the Plan</h2>
<p>We start by creating a new plan. The initial steps are the same as in&#160;<a hqid="284774" href="#">Create a Basic Plan</a>. We give the plan a name: 3 Favorites 5 Minutes.</p>
<p><img src="images/dialog_Add_Plan_3_favorites_5_minutes.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>The Per Call Limit setting is the key here. This means that when customers make a call, the call length is limited by the amount of minutes you define here.</p>
<p>When the call limit or plan usage limit is reached, several things can happen:</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249);">
<li>When the per-call limit is reached, the call can either end automatically or continue.
<ul>
<li>If the customer has no fall-back voice plans, the call will end automatically.</li>
<li>If the customer has at least one fall-back voice plan, the call can continue, and will consume voice minutes from the customer's voice plans.
<div class="warning">This can happen only when the priority of the feature that contains the behavior policy is higher than the priority of the feature that contains the voice service policy used in the fall-back plans. See&#160;<a hqid="232050" href="#">Feature Settings</a>&#160;for more information about setting feature priorities.</div>
</li>
<li>In any of these cases, a preferred destination call can end and a customer can initiate a new preferred destination call until the preferred destination plan usage limit is reached.&#160;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the plan usage limit is reached, no more favorites calls can be made during the current plan cycle. Additional voice calls use any voice plans a customer may have.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to a per-call limit, when you create a plan using a behavior policy, you also define a total usage limit (see above) for favorites use. For example, the&#160;<a hqid="265687" href="#">behavior policy settings</a>&#160;allow you to define the total number of favorites slots. With this setting, you decide that each slot&#160;allows 5 minutes per call. If you define a behavior policy with 3 slots and put it in a plan and define&#160;100 minutes of usage, a customer who receives the plan can make as many favorites calls as they want up to a total of 100 minutes. This total usage limit helps&#160;curtail abuse.</p>
<p>You have to at least promote a plan (although you do not have to approve it) before you can use it in a notification. So go to the Site Updates &gt; My Changes page and promote the 3 Favorites 5 Minutes plan.</p>
<h2>Create the Notification Body</h2>
<p>Notifications have 2 parts: bodies and shells.&#160;</p>
<p>We start by going to the Notification Bodies page to <a hqid="288791" href="#">create a notification body</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_Commerce_Notification_Bodies.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>There are several types of notifications. We want to use a Usage notification, so click on Usage.</p>
<p><img src="images/menu_Notification_Bodies_Usage.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>Add Usage Notification Body</strong>. As we've been doing, we'll give it the name 3 Favorites 5 Minutes.</p>
<p><img src="images/dialog_Add_Usage_Notification_Body.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>Usage notifications have 3 sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description: Which you filled out when you created it.</li>
<li>Criteria: The definition of what triggers the notification. There are rules, thresholds, and contextual offers.</li>
<li>Content: The audio, text and buttons of a notification.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Criteria Definition</h3>
<p>For this plan, we want to add one rule and one threshold in the Criteria section. The rule is to match the plan, and the threshold defines when the notification trigger happens.</p>
<p>Rule setting: Click +Rule, Select <strong>Product - Name</strong>, <strong>is equal to</strong>, and then click Lookup to select the 3 Favorites 5 Minutes plan.</p>
<p>Threshold setting: Click +Add, select <strong>Units Remaining</strong>, enter 1, and select <strong>Voice Minutes</strong>. For <em>Applies to</em>, select <strong>Per call allowance</strong>.</p>
<p>The result of these values is that when a customer is making a call using this plan, the notification will trigger when there is 1 minute left in the call.</p>
<h3>Content Definition</h3>
<p>Notification content can contain text and sound. Text content appears on a customer's device screen. Sound content is played through a customer's device audio output.</p>
<p>For this plan, we want customers to get the notification while they are making a call to let them know that their time is running out. Therefore, textual content isn't useful. But we do want to add audio content.&#160;</p>
<p>Click <strong>No</strong> for <em>Add text?</em> and <strong>Yes</strong> for <em>Add audio?</em>, then see&#160;<a hqid="288778" href="#">Add Audio Translations to a Notification</a>&#160;for instructions.</p>
<p>Also, click <strong>Yes</strong> for <em>Play when user is on a call?</em> because that's exactly what you want to happen.</p>
<p>This is the final setting we want to get the desired notification behavior, so we just save and <a hqid="288838" href="#">finalize the notification body</a>.</p>
<h2>Create the Notification</h2>
<p>See <a hqid="288792" href="#">Add a Notification</a>.</p>
<p>We want to add a usage notification and give it the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: 3 Favorites 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Core Notification: Click Lookup to select the notification body we just created.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you save the notification, you have to take it through the same <a hqid="288860" href="#" style="line-height: 19.6000003814697px;">promote</a><span style="line-height: 19.6000003814697px;">,</span> <a hqid="288799" href="#"><span style="line-height: 19.6000003814697px;">app</span><span style="line-height: 19.6000003814697px;">rove, and deploy</span></a> <span style="line-height: 19.6000003814697px;">process as any other change, except after you promote it, you should <a hqid="288884" href="#">test it</a>&#160;(which is done using <a hqid="288880" href="#">sandboxes</a>) before you approve and deploy it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 19.6000003814697px;">When the notification is deployed, it gets pushed to ItsOn Smart Services-powered devices.&#160;</span></p>
