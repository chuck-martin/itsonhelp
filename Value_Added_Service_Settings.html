<p>Required. This is a text string that uniquely identifies a specific service to your aggregators that fulfill the value-added service. This is the identifier that the aggregator will recognize and match in its database so it can activate the correct service.</p>
<p>The aggregator provides the operator with a list of codes, each defining a specific service that the aggregator will fulfill. When you're creating a value-added service product, you will select a code from that list and enter it here.&#160;</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes - To allow the value-added service product to have as many cycles as defined in <strong>Number of Cycles</strong>. Once a customer receives the value-added service product, it continues to renew for as many cycles as defined in <strong>Number of Cycles</strong>, or until renewal is canceled.</li>
<li>No - To restrict the value-added service product to just one cycle. This is the setting you would normally use when you choose <em>Download</em> for the <strong>How customer gets product</strong> setting because in many cases, you're offering a single digital product. (There may be cases where this is not the case. For example, it's possible to have an app-of-the-month offering, so each month, customers could click the link provided to access download of app offered each month.)</li>

<p>Required. This defines the number of cycles a subscriber can receive the value-added service product. The options determine if a value-added service product repeats at the end of its duration. If so, the customer is grandfathered the plan rate and attributes when it is renewed, even if you have made <a href="#">significant changes</a> to the plan or even deleted it from your catalog. Available only when <strong>Recurring</strong> is set to <em>Yes</em>.</p>
<p>This value should match the number of subscription cycles defined by the aggregator for the value-added service identified by the <strong>SDP Product ID</strong>. If it does not, potential customer issues could occur, especially if this value is greater than the number of subscription cycles offered for the value-added service.&#160;&#160;In that case, customers will continue to be charged for additional cycles of the product after the value-added service subscription ends.</p>
<p>Select from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited: Subscribers can continue to receive (and pay for) the plan as long as they want.</li>
<li>
<p>Limited to: Enter the number of cycles of the plan that can be received.</p>
<div class="warning">You can enter only positive integers (1, 37, 5287024, etc.) in this field. Zero, negative numbers, and decimal numbers (0, 0.5, 3.1415926, 2.5, etc.) are not allowed.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Value-added service products renew when they are set to an unlimited number of cycles or when they are "limited" to more than one cycle, that is, the number in the <em>Limited to</em> option is greater than 1. Renewing means that at the end of a value-added service product's cycle duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cycle starts over.</li>
<li>Billing occurs.</li>

<p>Required. This defines how long a value-added service product cycle is. Select from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unlimited. This means that there is no time limit for customers to redeem the value-added service and it will stay on the customer's My Plans page forever.</p>
<div class="warning">If a cycle duration is unlimited, then you must select <em>Limited to</em> in the <strong>Number of Cycles</strong> setting and enter 1. Products with an unlimited cycle duration may not have more than one cycle.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lasts, then enter a number and select a unit of measure from minute(s), hour(s), week(s), day(s), or month(s). This sets a time limit to redeem the value-added serivce.</p>

<p>When customers buy value-added service products, they can view how long they have left to redeem the value-added service in the My Plans section of the self-care app.</p>
<p>The usage display shows the time usage. Select:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duration: To show a bar and label for time used and available.<br />
<img alt="" src="images/usage_display_cycle3.png" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></li>
<li>None: To show no duration information. Customers will have no information about how much time they have before the value-added service expires.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bar and Label Direction and Position</h4>
<p>The direction of bar movement and the position of labels in relation to the bar (to the right or left of the bar) depend on tenant settings and/or language (left-to-right or right-to-left) settings.</p>
<p>First, whether the bars are count up (for example, Day 7 of 15) or count down (for example, 8 days remaining) depends on a tenant setting.</p>
<p>Then, the direction that the bar moves (or fills) depends on a tenant setting.</p>
<p>Finally, if there is a label, its location depends on language settings. If the language setting is left-to-right, the label will be to the right of the bar. If the language setting is right-to-left, the label will be to the left of the bar.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Visibility</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Determines whether or not the value-added service product is visible to customers.</p>
<p>Because a value-added service product is a link that's delivered to customers, and customers have to click on that link to activate the third-party product, if you hide the value-added service product, customers will not be able to use it. You should ether not make a selection for this setting or select only <em>Yes</em>, or you should make sure that a non-zero price is entered so you cannot make a selection at all for this setting.</p>
<p>If this is set to <em>Hide</em>, the value-added service product is not visible for purchase in the store nor is it visible in a customer's account information. It is not shown as part of a <a href="#">bundle</a> when included in a bundle. For more on how hidden products work in bundles, see <a href="#">Hidden Products in Bundles</a>.</p>
<div class="warning">A value-added service product cannot be hidden unless its price is equal to 0 (zero). This is because at checkout, a non-zero priced product in the cart will result in a total price that is different from the sum of the prices of the visible products, which could cause customer confusion. So this setting is unavailable until a price value greater than 0 (zero) has been entered for the value-added service product.</div>

<tr>
<td><strong>How customer gets product</strong></td>

<p>Determines whether this is a buy and activate value-added service or a buy and download value-added service. Select:</p>
<ul>

<p>In either case, this insures that customers receive redemption instructions appropriate to the value-added service type.</p>

<p>Overrides the Retail Price while allowing you to keep a record of the retail price. To return to the Retail Price, delete the contents of this field.</p>
<div class="tip">A Sale Price can affect whether customers qualify for <a href="#">offers</a> (benefits and discounts), depending on the value of the <em>Apply to sale price</em> setting in the offer.</div>
<p>When a customer is viewing the catalog, both the sale price and the retail price are visible in the product listing. The exact appearance will depend on your branding. The following graphic is an example of what customers might see in a product where the Retail Price is 1.00 and the Sale Price is 0.80:</p>
<p><img src="images/client_sale_price.png" alt="" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" border="1" /></p>
<div class="info">Some research suggests that consumers believe prices with more syllables are higher than the same prices with fewer syllables, and this is seen in both spoken and printed prices. Both commas and decimal points add to the "syllables," so, for example, $1,199.00 is viewed as more than $1199. ItsOn provides a client-side branding setting that can present catalog prices without the decimal and the digits after the decimal for whole number prices. If this setting were used for the example above, the values seen in the catalog presentation would be $1 and $0.80. This setting does not affect the amounts you enter in the Retail Price Price or the Sale Price fields, nor the amounts shown during checkout, in customer invoices, and in customer service records.</div>
